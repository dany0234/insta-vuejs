# insta-vuejs
Instagram project


Web application that is a replica of Instagram.
I included most of the Instagram features such as: 

 *Account and login authentication.
 *Creating a new post.
 *liking and commenting posts. 
Personal data and filters for posts.  

The App was written on vscode in vuejs framework with reusable components.
Sccs and svgâ€™s to make it as accurate as possible. 

Nodejs for the server side with rest api queries and Mongodb as the database with Posts and Users as collections.
